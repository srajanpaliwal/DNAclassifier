# EEL6935 Big Data Ecosystems  Project
## Problem Statement
In this competition, you are provided the labeled data of SP1 transcription factor binding and non-binding sites on human chromosome1. There are 1000 sequences for binding sites and 1000 sequences for non-binding sites. Each sequence has 14 nucleotide base pairs. There are four different nucleobase types in the DNA sequence: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T). The sequences in the dataset are also denoted by these letters.
